Fot the home assignment, I imported a list of airports 'airportlist' (from Github) as the indice, via the Algolia platform.

I used the tutorial for the InstantSearch and adapt it to my indice.
I've modified the way data is display and the result disposition.

I've also created Query Rules when it is containing France or United States, to force a specific airport. I've removed un-used CSS, JS fonctions and other files.

I've linked my Algolia account to my Github account.
I also gave read access to Algolia Support.

Thanks for the future review.
